### NO LONGER USED WITH ORACC II installations; use repo oracc1 instead

This repository contains the core source code for Oracc, the Open
Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus.

All of the material in this repo--source code, fonts, etc., all of
it--is released into the Public Domain by its author, Steve Tinney
(stinney@upenn.edu).

If you are interested in installing Oracc I suggest you contact
me--installation is not too difficult, but it is not quite an
out-of-the-box exercise either.  The starting point for installation
notes is the file ORACC-INSTALL in this repo.

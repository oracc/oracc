  <h2>Oracc ATF Text Template Generator</h2>
  <p>This form creates ATF templates to take some of the drudgery out
  of typing texts.  The results are not intended to be perfect; the
  idea is just to give a useful start to text-typing.</p>
  <p style="color:red">Documentation is at <a href="#doco">the end of this file</a>.</p>
  <p>To use it, just type or paste template specifications into the
  text field below; more documentation is given after the text field.
  The output is sent back as a text document to the same window as you
  are using; just select all, copy it and paste it into your text
  editor.  You can either give fragments to get templates--without
  even an &amp;-line--or you can make templates for an entire volume
  of texts and expand them all to include their P-numbers,
  designations, block structure and line numbers at one fell
  swoop.</p>
  <p>(If your list of templates is more than a few hundred lines you may
  need to split it into several chunks to process it all
  successfully.)</p>

<h2 name="doco" id="doco">Documentation</h2>
  <p>The input is a series of lines: lines that start with '&amp;' are
  ATF &amp;-lines; if the line has an ID starting with P or Q, the
  designation is looked up and added; if it has an ID starting with X,
  or if it has no ID the template generator tries to find the P-number
  for the text based on the rest of the line (if there is an X-ID, the
  rest of the line following the '=' sign is used).  If it can't find a
  P-ID it just outputs the &amp;-line unchanged.  If multiple P-IDs
  appear to match the keys in the &amp;-line, all the matches are
  output.</p>
  <p>If a line starts with '#' it is a comment; the line is passed
  through unchanged.</p>
  <p>Otherwise, the line is parsed as a list of block and line-number
  specifications.  Each specification token is separated by spaces.
  The rules for the tokens are simple:</p>
<pre>
o = obverse         r = reverse

le = leftedge       re = rightedge     te = topedge       be = bottomedge

c&lt;N&gt; = column N

N = line number     N1-N2 = range of line numbers
</pre>
  <p>The normal prime, exclamation and question-mark flags are allowed
  at the end of any token; in addition, three special flags are
  understood which create $-lines instead of block tags and line
  numbers:</p>
<pre>
] = broken   # = traces    _ = blank
</pre>
  <p>A special distinction is made in $-specifiers between
  <code>cN]</code> and <code>Nc]</code>: the former generates <code>$
  column N broken</code>; the latter generates <code>$ N columns
  broken</code>.</p>
  <p>The special codes <code>c-]</code> and <code>c+]</code> generate
  <code>$ start of column broken</code> and <code>$ rest of column
  broken</code> respectively; the other special flags behave similarly.</p>
  <p>Similarly, <code>o-], o+], r-], r+]</code>, and all the other surface
  designators, produce <code>$ start of obverse broken</code>, etc.</p>
  <p>It's easiest to learn to use this utility by
  playing with it, but here is an example:</p>
<pre>
&amp;P100001
#a comment
1-2 3] 1'-3' r c1 1-3 c2#
</pre>
<p>Generates</p>

&amp;P100001 = AAS 013

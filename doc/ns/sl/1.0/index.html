  Sign list source files are maintained as a simple
  plain text file with @-commands in the manner of Oracc
  glossaries. This document gives an simple overview of the SL
  commands.

<h2><a name="Structure/scope">Structure/scope</a></h2>

<p>The general structure of the file is a collection of records, one
per sign.  Each record contains a partly-ordered set of fields, i.e.,
there are some key elements of the ordering that are important but
there is not a single strict order imposed on every field in the
record.  These ordering restrictions apply to the
<code>@form</code> field and also to a group of fields whose scope is
dependent on where they occur relative to other fields.</p>

<p>By convention, <code>@form</code> fields come at the end of the
<code>@sign</code> block, immediately before the <code>@end
sign</code>.  This allows there to be a short version and a long
version of the <code>@form</code> field.  If a <code>@form</code> is
followed immediately by another <code>@form</code> or by <code>@end
sign</code> then it is considered complete and <code>@end form</code>
is silently supplied by the parser.  If a <code>@form</code> field is
followed by another other sign field, it must be concluded with
<code>@end form</code>.</p>

<p>The scoped fields apply either to signs, forms or values, depending
on where they are given.  If they occur before any values or forms,
they belong to the sign.  If they occur within a form, but before any
values which the form may contain, they belong to the form.  If they
occur after a value, they belong to the value.</p>

<p>The scoped fields are: <code>@note</code>, <code>@inote</code>, and
<code>@inst</code>.</p>

<h2><a name="Signs">Signs</a></h2>

<p>Each sign is enclosed in an <code>@sign ... @end sign</code>
block.  After the <code>@sign</code> comes the sign name, which is the
standard way of referring to the sign and must be unique.  The sign
name is constructed using the conventions of GDL, the grapheme
description language used by ATF.</p>

<h2><a name="Forms">Forms</a></h2>

<p>Any sign may contain <code>@form</code> entries which at their
simplest give a form variant code and a name for the variant form.
The form variant codes and names must be unique within the current
sign.  The form may contain also contain any of the fields which may
be part of a sign, except for nested <code>@form</code> entries.</p>

<p>In a <code>@form</code> field, the variant code is given by tilde
followed by one or more lowercase letters (<code>~a</code>
... <code>~aa</code> etc.).</p>

<h2><a name="Values">Values</a></h2>

<p>The most common field of <code>@sign</code> is the value, and we
call the values of a top-level <code>@sign</code> global values.
Global values must be unique with respect to each other, i.e., each
global value may only occur once as a value of a top-level
<code>@sign</code>.</p>

<p>Values These are usually simply a reading of the sign, but
additional information can be given on the <code>@v</code> line:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Questionable value</dt>
<dd>A questionable value is indicated by putting question mark after
the field name, as in <code>@v? id₅</code>.</dd>

<dt>Deprecated value</dt>
<dd>A deprecated value, one which is no longer considered allowable
for the sign or form, is indicated by putting a minus sign after the
field name, as in <code>@v- gazum₂</code>.</dd>

<dt>Language restriction</dt>
<dd>A value which is only valid for one language may be indicated by
putting an ATF language code between the field name and the value, as
in <code>@v %elx anše@d</code>.</dd>

<dt>Proof Example</dt>
<dd>A proof example may be given on the same line, after the
value. These are not needed for most values, but where a value is
contested and a particular instance is critical to the proof of the
value's existence, the instance may be given in square brackets,
following the general conventions for instances described elsewhere in
this document. E.g., <code class="cookbook">@v nanna₂ [SpTu 2 36 =
cams:P348641 o 18, i-nanna₂-ma]</code>.</dd>

</dl>

<h3><a name="Local_Values">Local Values</a></h3>

<p>Forms can contain <code>@v</code> lines: we call these local
values.  Local values may occur more than once in the signlist,
either as values of top-level <code>@sign</code>s or as values of
other forms.  Within the signlist system, local values are always
considered to be qualified by their form.  Thus, if you have the
following mythical sign:</p>

<pre class="example">
@sign BA
@v ba
@form ~a ZU
@v ba
@end form
@end sign
</pre>

<p>the actual values as internalized by the signlist system are:</p>

<pre class="example">
ba
ba(BA~a)
ba(ZU)
</pre>

<p>Of these, the first two are guaranteed to be unique as a result of
the sign/form name and value restrictions on uniqueness described
above. The third is potentially ambiguous (imagining how such an
ambiguity could arise is left as an exercise for the reader).  When
entering data, however, it is convenient for users to be able to use
the form name as a qualifier and only look up the variant code when
the system warns about ambiguity.</p>

<h2><a name="Instances">Instances</a></h2>

<p>Although the general idea of GSL is that instances should be
harvested from the corpora, it is possible to include instances
manually if so desired.  The format of an instance consists of the
field name, <code>@inst</code>, followed by the instance data.  The
instance data may contain up to three subfields, but no restrictions
are imposed on which of them are present.  These subfields are:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Citation</dt>
<dd>A human-readable citation, usually the name of the text.  If
further subfields are given the citation <strong>must</strong> be
followed by an equals sign (<code>=</code>).</dd>
<dt>CDL Label</dt>
<dd>A CDL label is a standard label documented elsewhere.  Briefly, a
label consists of an optional project abbreviation, a required text ID
(P- or Q-number), and an optional line label.  An example is given
above in the discussion of proof examples.</dd>
<dt>Word</dt>
<dd>A word may come at the end of an instance, in which case it
<strong>must</strong> be preceded by a comma followed by a space.  The
word should be a word form which occurs in the line, omitting any
editorial marks such as flags and bracketing (though it may have
determinative brackets).</dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name="Notes">Notes</a></h2>

<p>One or more notes may be given each in their own <code>@note</code>
field.  Notes of this kind appear in rendered versions of the sign
list such as web pages and PDFs.</p>

<h2><a name="Internal_Notes">Internal Notes</a></h2>

<p>Internal notes are given in <code>@inote</code> fields.  These are
exactly the same as <code>@note</code> fields, but they do not display
when the sign list is rendered.</p>

<h2><a name="Lists">Lists</a></h2>

<p>The numbers used for signs in other signlists are given using the
<code>@list</code> field.  This contains at least an ATF-style sign
list reference, e.g., <code>MZL503</code>. This may optionally be
followed by and ATF version of the name used in that signlist for the
sign in question.</p>

<h2><a name="Unicode_Fields">Unicode Fields</a></h2>

<p>Several fields are used for bookkeeping purposes with respet to the
Unicode cuneiform specification.  These are not yet documented.</p>

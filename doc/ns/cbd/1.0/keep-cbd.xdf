<h2>Preamble</h2>

<d:rnc>
default namespace = "http://oracc.org/ns/cbd/1.0"

<h2>Document</h2>

<p>The document element is <code>cbd</code> and has attributes to
specify various glossary parameters as follows:</p>

<dl>

<dt>project</dt>
<dd>The project the glossary belongs to, given in the @project header element.</dd>

<dt>xml:lang</dt>
<dd>The language of which the present CBD is a glossary, given in the
@lang header element.  This must be a legal ISO 639 code, with
private-use definitions as given in the <a
href="../GDL/index.html#langs">GDL documentation</a>.</dd>

<dt>name</dt>
<dd>The name of the glossary, given in the @name header element.</dd>

<dt>gdl:file</dt>
<dd>The filename of the glossary.</dd>
</dl>

<d:rnc>
cbd = element cbd { cbd-attr , declaration? , entry* }
cbd-attr    = (project , xml-lang , name , file)
project     = attribute project  { text }
xml-lang    = attribute xml:lang { text }
name        = attribute name     { text }
file	    = attribute gdl:file { text }
</d:rnc>

<h2>Declaration</h2>

<p>The CBD declaration defines parameters for the glossary including
its languages and properties.  A library of default parameters set by
language is available in <code>cdl/lib/cbd/&lt;LANG>.xml</code>; if
there is no <code>declaration</code>, or if the
<code>declaration</code> has <code>replace=no</code>, the processor
reads the system declaration for the <code>target-lang</code> before
proceeding.</p>

<d:rnc>
declaration =   element declaration { prop-replace? , prop-def* }
prop-replace =  attribute cbd:property-replace { xsd:boolean }
prop-def =      element property {
                  prop-scope , prop-name , prop-type ,  prop-sort , 
		  prop-gaps , prop-val* }
prop-scope =    attribute cbd:property-scope { "cbd" | "entry" }
prop-name  =    attribute cbd:property-name  { xsd:NMTOKEN }
prop-type =     attribute cbd:property-type  { "singleton" | "list" | "complex" }
prop-sort =     attribute cbd:property-sort  { 
                  "none" | "numeric" | "alpha" | "list" }
prop-gaps =     attribute cbd:property-gaps-ok { xsd:boolean }
prop-val =      element property-value { prop-val-type , text }
prop-val-type = attribute cbd:prop-ok-type {
                  "number" | "letter" | "token" | "pattern" }
</d:rnc>

<h2>Entries</h2>

<p>A CBD <code>entry</code> consists of several core elements and an
open-ended list of properties.  In this way the structure is adaptable
to different kinds of glossaries and languages.  For example, a
glossary of personal names can have properties giving genealogical
information for the persons referenced in the entries.</p>

<d:rnc>
entry = element entry { cf , gw , pos , sense* , properties }
</d:rnc>

<p>The core elements provide the essential structural data for the
glossaries and, optionally, the semantic outline.</p>

<h3>Structure</h3>

<p>The central structural mechanism for entries in the CBD
architecture is formed from three pieces of data: the <code>Citation
Form</code> (CF), i.e., the form of the word that is given as the
headword in the entry; the <code>Guide Word</code> (GW), i.e., a
disambiguating label which separates homophones; and the <code>Part Of
Speech</code> (POS), i.e., the syntactic function typically fulfilled
by the word.</p>

<p>In more traditional dictionaries the GW function is fulfilled by
letters or numbers, and there is nothing in the CBD definition to
prevent this from being the case in a CBD.  However, it is also common
in CBDs for the GW to be a word or phrase which orients the dictionary
user to the meaning or semantic realm of the term--hypernyms often
make good choices for GWs.  The use of unordered symbols of this kind
to disambiguate words permits deferral of decisions about the number
and ordering of homonyms, and is particularly useful for the
development phase of glossaries where the complete lexicon is unknown
during the corpus-building process.</p>

<p>The permitted values for GW can be specified in the declaration by
giving a <code>prop-def</code> entry for the property
<code>gw</code>.  Thus, to declare that GW is actually digits the
following entry can be given:</p>
<pre class="cookbook">&lt;property cbd:property-scope="cbd" cbd:property-name="gw">
  cbd:property-type="singleton" cbd:property-sort="numeric"
  cbd:property-gaps-ok="no">
  &lt;property-value type="number"/>
&lt;/property>
</pre>

<p>Similarly, the range of values of the <code>pos</code> element can
be constrained by giving a specification for the property
<code>pos</code> in the CBD declaration.</p>

<p>The content model of the structural elements is very weak because
there is an operating assumption that validation will be carried out
on the content--at least for <code>gw</code> and
<code>pos</code>--based on allowable values specified in the property
declarations.</p>

<d:rnc>
cf = element cf { text }
gw = element gw { text }
pos = element pos { text}
</d:rnc>

<h3>Semantics</h3>

<p>The CBD provides a built-in structure for dictionary definitions.
The structure is recursive to arbitrary levels and provides support
for multiple glossary-writing styles as well as tie-ins with the CDL
lemmatizer.</p>

<p>Note that the specification for <code>definition</code> permits
arbitrary structured content to be included here and subsequently
processed by glossary-specific plug-ins.</p>

<d:rnc>
sense      = element sense { (gw? , pos? , 
                              ((glosses , definition?) | definition)),
			     sense*
             }

glosses    = element glosses { text }
definition = element definition { text | anyElement }
anyElement = element * { attribute * { text }* , (anyElement | text)* }
</d:rnc> 

<h3>Properties</h3>

<p>The property framework enables CBDs to be configured to the needs
of various languages and target data types.  The framework is generic
and recursive, meaning that complex properties are also supported.</p>

<p>Properties consist of at most three components: a required name,
given in the <code>n</code> attribute; a required value or reference,
given either as a <code>v</code> attribute, a <code>v</code> element
or, for references, an <code>r</code> attribute; and an optional key
symbol, given with a <code>k</code> attribute.</p>

<p>The key symbol may be used for sorting and cross-referencing. In
the following example of the use of cross-referencing, the Sumerian
verb ŋar[place] has several stems, each of which may be written in
several ways.  We call the writing of a stem a <code>base</code>, so
the relationship between stem and base can be defined as follows:</p>

<pre class="example">    &lt;prop n="stem" v="B">
      &lt;prop n="form" v="&#x14B;ar"/>
      &lt;prop n="func" v="perf"/>
    &lt;/prop>
    &lt;prop n="stem" v="B">
      &lt;prop n="form" v="mar"/>
      &lt;prop n="func" v="perf"/>
      &lt;prop n="rws" v="ES"/>
    &lt;/prop>
    &lt;prop n="base" v="&#x14B;ar">
      &lt;prop n="stem" r="#form=ŋar"/>
    &lt;/prop>
    &lt;prop n="base" v="ma·ra">
      &lt;prop n="stem" r="#form=mar"/>
    &lt;/prop>
</pre>

<p>The (incomplete and simplified) example enumerates the stems of the
verb--there is a B (base) stem with perfective function in the default
register/writing-system with the form <code>ŋar</code>, and another
form, <code>mar</code> of the B-perfective used in Emesal.  The
orthographic bases on which forms are constructed are given in the
<code>base</code> property.  The bases reference the stems via the
<code>form</code> property of the <code>stem</code> properties.  This
permits complex co-validation of the lemmatized instance-data: the
lemmatizer uses the glossary to ensure, for example, that a lemmatized
form uses a combination of base and stem which is valid according to
the entry's properties.  If a base can be used to write several stems,
the lemmatizer can issue a diagnostic if no stem is specified; if the
base is used to write only one stem, the lemmatizer can supply the
stem from the base if the user has not done so.</p>

properties = element prop { name , 
                            ((value , key?) | ref),
			    properties }*

name  = attribute n { xsd:NMTOKEN }
value = attribute v { text } | element v { text | anyElement }
key   = attribute k { text }
ref   = attribute r { text }

* No longer use ? for unknown value; use 'x' instead

  @v	? [SF 064 = dcclt:P010655 o iii 14]

  =>

  @v	x [SF 064 = dcclt:P010655 o iii 14]


* No longer use ? after value to express uncertainty; use @v?

  @v	dur₂?

  =>

  @v?	dur₂

* Comments are no longer allowed as part of @v; use '@inote' instead or @v- instead

  @v	#nib leb

  =>

  @v	leb
  @inote nib
  
  OR

  @v	nigidaeš
  @v	#old nieš

  =>

  @v	nigidaeš
  @v-	nieš
  @inote old

* What about

  @v [...]ingara

  Which ATF would complain about and cannot be validated as a (partial) value; write xingara instead?  Or have a notation to allow a validatable value e.g.

  @v <xingara> [...]ingara

?

* We probably need split/merger tags with some sort of time/place labelling

* Maybe an ATF convention to say sign-X-is-written-with-glyph-Y without implying that Y has to be a known form of X

* add @lref MZL432a to reference signlist items that are not otherwise
  referenced in OGSL, explained formally through @note (required) and
  informally through @inote

* add @cite for a citation of an occurrence; same syntax as [...] proof

* When the lhs of a × compound is itself a compound it may be
  convenient to use a value as a sign, e.g., |ITI×(U.U.U)@g| rather
  than |UD×(U.U.U)×(U.U.U)@g| (though this particular example is
  suspicious); allowable sign name alternatives can be given with the
  @name ITI tag

* @aka can be used to create entire compound names that are also
  accepted by GVL, e.g., @sign |MAŠ.MI| @aka |MAŠ.GI₆|

* for components of compounds that are not signs, use @comp GU@90

* @form entries that do not exist separately as @sign are handled
  automatically and do not need to be declared as @signs

! Should validate multiple base-values e.g., šudul₄ and šudul₅ in same sign or form

* Qualified-value (qv) requirements: sl-db2.plx enforced unnecessary
  qv requirements.  The new qv requirements are:

  ** all ₓ-values must be qualified all non-ₓ-values which occur with
  ** more than one @form must be qualified when they are written with
  ** a form (i.e., they default to the sign-writing if they are not
  ** qualified and there is a sign-writing)

* Comments -- @inote, @note, @lit, #-comments, are always attached to
  the most recent instance node: this means @sign, @list, @form or @v.
  This means that when OGSL is processed, the location of these
  comments may change slightly.  It also means that proper OGSL
  practice is to specify these immediately after an instance node.

* Possibly don't allow #-comments; use @inote or @sign-/@form-/@list-/@v- 

* Does sx need a true identity mode? Or is it OK to relocate notes, for
  example--could implement true identity by using line numbers of
  input file as a sort key but is it worth it?

* Unicode data block must come at the beginning, only at the
  definitional instance, and can occur in any order but will be
  reordered in processing to a fixed field sequence (give sequence).

* Compute @uchar/@ucode?

* should OGSL be divided into sections: Non-numeric, Numeric, for example

* should there be a Unicode block tag?

* Uniqueness constraints:

  ** Signs must be unique across @sign and @sign- combined
  ** Forms must be unique within each @sign across @form and @form- combined
  ** Values must be unique within each @sign or @form across @v and @v- combined

  In other words, you can't say @sign- A and @sign A, etc.

* Should validation require unicode info to be repeated for @form
  which are @sign or require it to be omitted? Should pick one and not
  do a hybrid; require info in "defining instance", i.e., @sign or one
  of the times a @form is used which is not a @sign

* No longer use ? for unknown value; use 'x' instead; must have a unique subscript

  @v	? [SF 064 = dcclt:P010655 o iii 14]

  =>

  @v	x₁ [SF 064 = dcclt:P010655 o iii 14]


* No longer use ? after value to express uncertainty; use @v?

  @v	dur₂?

  =>

  @v?	dur₂

* Comments are no longer allowed as part of @v; use '@inote' instead or @v- instead

  @v	#nib leb

  =>

  @v	leb
  @inote nib
  
  OR

  @v	nigidaeš
  @v	#old nieš

  =>

  @v	nigidaeš
  @v-	nieš
  @inote old

* What about

  @v [...]ingara

  Which ATF would complain about and cannot be validated as a (partial) value; write xingara instead?  Or have a notation to allow a validatable value e.g.

  @v <xingara> [...]ingara

?

* We probably need split/merger tags with some sort of time/place labelling

* Notation for logograms, e.g.,

  @logo A
  @equ %akk mû
  @cgp mû[water]N
  @ref ME 237 CD 213b ZL 435

  For Akkadograms

  @logo %a A

  etc.

* Maybe an ATF convention to say sign-X-is-written-with-glyph-Y without implying that Y has to be a known form of X

* How would we define @form? Cases like A ...

* Do we need a notation for X-is-abbreviated-as-Y (e.g., LAGAB×A written as A)?

* Do we add such abbreviations to OGSL or are they part of spelling of words? KU in ED IIIa; probably many other examples

* Do we need the ~a part of @form--is it ever used/will we ever use it? It makes sorting of forms counter-intuitive

* Do we need @end form?

* Should forms automatically inherit all values or should we parse the
  corpus for actual attestations and set up OGSL based on that, then
  add new values to @form only when they are encountered?

* Should we then normalize values in @form to the versions in @sign when there are minor differences, e.g., sim/sem?

* Should we provide Unicode rendering guidelines for @fake signs like PN?

* I would like to reassign signs which should be forms to be forms via
  some kind of computational process that uses ePSD to group writings
  of addir, for example, into a single place rather than many places

* Need @alias tag to allow, say, an LAK number to be a legal sign name
  where the actual sign name is cumbersom?

  Implementation: @alias would be confusable with Sumerian aliasing as
  used in ePSD so we use @aka as the tag.  @aka in @sign or @form is a
  simple referer: it points to the previous @form or @sign and is
  output to the db as name;aka--this means that GVL can avoid setting
  a reciprocal OID->AKA hash entry

* Need @xref tag or implicit xreffing of notes within forms that occur
  more than once; in which case, we probably need instance-specific
  notes vs. global notes.

  ** @inote -- internal note, no replication/xreffing/printing
  ** @xnote -- printed note automatically gets xreffed if it the sign/form is used more than once
  ** @lnote -- local note, only applicable to instance of sign/form where it occurs
  ** @unote -- unicode note which is intended to be actionable in UC; otherwise use [ixl]note

* Why does @fake need an argument? Just use @fake instead of @fake 1.

* What are %akk values? %elx are Elamite ones: does %akk mean "only in Akkadian"

* What are %akk/n values? Logograms? Remove to @inote?

*** Niek 20230717

* Any general thoughts at the outset?

* This convo is partly general preliminary and partly some minor
  immediate needs; would like to have a convo with an agenda and some
  explanatory notes soon-ish

* OGSL is our working data: are we OK making it a public part of the
  Unicode Cuneiform (UC) work or do we feel that will constrain our
  ability to change freely as we need?

* If we are concerned about that freedom, would we maintain a
  derivative of OGSL that could serve UC needs?

* Does NV want to be part of this possible UC initiative?

* Are there any other Assyriologists we could/should include? Emilie? Laura Hawkins?

* Do we feel that Robin is sufficient for non-Assyriological input? Debbie Anderson? Everson??

* Generally OK with minor changes to format of OGSL?

  ** Make '?' always follow graphemes/list numbers for questionable items (no @v? always @v a?)
  
  ** All removed sign/form/value marked with @sign- / @form- / @v- instead of the @nosign tag
  
  ** Write x for unknown sign-reading rather than '?'
  
  ** Write [x]ingara rather than [...]ingara because with legacy in
     effect [x]ingara would be legal ATF (this is desirable because
     then the rule can be that anything after @sign/@form/@v (except
     for '[Pxxx ...]' refs) must be well-formed ATF; right now that
     can't be the case); this would mean there are values with 'x' in
     them to indicate missing parts, like xingara which would be a
     little odd-looking but they would be consistent and unambiguous
     (even in CDLI ASCII ATF final 'x' must be followed by '(' so an x
     not followed by '(' would be legal if part of zi[...] =>
     zix). There are 36 of these partially broken values in OGSL

  ** Remove Civil's /šumun/-type values? Or at least reserve them to
     @inote?  Or give them a different tag (@word?) There are 15 of
     them.  They can't be used as values, so they shouldn't be @v.

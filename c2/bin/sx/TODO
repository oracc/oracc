c2/nss/asl , c2/nss/gdl , c2/bin/sx TODO list as of 2023-08-02
==============================================================

Implementation
--------------

* BUG @aka |ŠE₃.TU.BU| occurs twice and is duplicated on output both times

* add @system vel sim to allow

  @sys attinger guniŋₓ ~ buniŋₓ
  @sys cdli du₁₁ ~ dug₄

* values with ATF flag (u-gun₃, {kaš}ulušin) should be parsed as GDL;
  should they have their own @atf tag?

* GDL for '@form 15' is not quite right; needs sexified form attribute

* check that it is impossible for an @aka also to exist as a different
  token type

* related to removal of ';aka' : GVL should have option to report
  matches made through an @aka

* Rename listdata files as ldata to align with udata

* Write sxcheckudata.sh to ensure that list-dump and udata output have the same # of U+ signs

* fix internal names of tag @utf8-related functions to match new name for tag which is @ucun

* also fix SLL name for @utf8 -> @ucun, which is still uchar :( but should be ucun now

* Fix utf8 in schema and in sx_w_xml.c; add umap to schema

* validate umap targets as part of sx_marshall--must be valid names which have Unicode info


Schema
------

* rnc/asl.rnc is wrong/too weak for g:g--needs fixing to correct GDL


Output
------

* values with ATF flag are not yet output in XML version; they are
  correctly excluded in SLL and correctly included in ASL outputs.

* Complete XML output for new tags

* More better JSON output


Documentation
-------------

* What happened with = for literal? Is it needed with @aka support?

* Document differences

  - no inline refs
  - ? always after value
  - end form is now @@
  - new tags signlist listdef ref lref sref
  - Unicode tags revised
    @ucode -> @list U+, @useq, @upua
    @uchar -> @utf8

* Document maintainer notes for OID curation

* List/need listnum pages

* Unicode deprecated/missing should have unote in last column about why

* Unicode need should have citation and character image


OGSL Fixes
----------

* re-generate ogsl.asl with new ordering

* edit X.Y&X.Y to (X.Y)&(X.Y) and add @aka X.Y&X.Y

* import @uphase 0 as @uage 0; add @uage 9 based on unicode-not-encoded status

* rewrite Attinger values using @sys

* How to represent double-encoded Unicode characters like
  U+1243A--they need to show up in the unicode data table in some
  reasonable way

* OGSL and OIDs page (perhaps on Maintainer page)

* add MURUB₄ @umap NISAG and DE₂ @umap |UMUM×KASKAL|

* Reformat all the fields that use LONG-TEXT so they are at most, say,
  80 characters long

* redo the OIDs and tag a baseline OGSL repo for future tracking

* add @version/@date tags? determine and document release vs. updates

* BU@90 not in the needed list but should be

Future
------

* how to encode splits and mergers?

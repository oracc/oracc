c2/nss/asl , c2/nss/gdl , c2/bin/sx TODO list as of 2023-08-02
==============================================================

* values with ATF flag (u-gun₃, {kaš}ulušin) should be parsed as GDL

* values with ATF flag are not yet output in XML version; they are
  correctly excluded in SLL and correctly included in ASL outputs.

* JSON output

* validate and autogenerate @ucode entries

* implement @cite tag and convert artificial @v x values to use it

* implement @listdef tag and create entries for built-in lists (see
  lib/sll/sll_signlist.g)

* rnc/asl.rnc is wrong/too weak for g:g--needs fixing to correct GDL

* GDL for '@form 15' is not quite right; needs sexified form attribute

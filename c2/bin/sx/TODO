c2/nss/asl , c2/nss/gdl , c2/bin/sx TODO list as of 2023-08-02
==============================================================

Implementation
--------------

* add @system vel sim to allow

  @sys attinger guniŋₓ ~ buniŋₓ
  @sys cdli du₁₁ ~ dug₄

* Implement @upua

* implement @ref tag and convert artificial @v x values to use it

* values with ATF flag (u-gun₃, {kaš}ulušin) should be parsed as GDL;
  should they have their own @atf tag?

* GDL for '@form 15' is not quite right; needs sexified form attribute

* Change output order for @sign to @aka @list @unicode-block -- done, CHECK

* check that it is impossible for an @aka also to exist as a different
  token type

* related to removal of ';aka' : GVL should have option to report
  matches made through an @aka

* Check if notes can go with @signlist

Schema
------

* rnc/asl.rnc is wrong/too weak for g:g--needs fixing to correct GDL


Output
------

* values with ATF flag are not yet output in XML version; they are
  correctly excluded in SLL and correctly included in ASL outputs.

* Complete XML output for new tags

* More better JSON output


Documentation
-------------

* What happened with = for literal? Is it needed with @aka support?

* Document differences

  - no inline refs
  - ? always after value
  - end form is now @@
  - new tags signlist listdef ref lref sref
  - Unicode tags revised
    @ucode -> @list U+, @useq, @upua
    @uchar -> @utf8

* Document maintainer notes for OID curation

* List/need listnum pages

* Unicode not-encoded pages

OGSL Fixes
----------

* edit X.Y&X.Y to (X.Y)&(X.Y) and add @aka X.Y&X.Y

* re-generate ogsl.asl with new ordering

* import @uphase 0 as @uage 0; add @uage 9 based on unicode-not-encoded status

* rewrite Attinger values using @sys

Future
------

* how to encode splits and mergers?

  @sign TUG₂
  @merge >MB> KU

  @sign EŠ₂
  @from <ED< NAM₂

  @sign KU
  @from <MB< TUG₂;EŠ₂

  @sign BA
  @split >NA> BA~a BA~b

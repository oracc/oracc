* These are some transient notes on what Steve has to do to
  uptranslate /home/oracc/ogsl/00lib/ogsl.asl to the revised format
  used by the new signlist processor, sx

** Run ../../../misc/sl/sl-upgrade.plx /home/oracc/ogsl/00lib/ogsl.asl >ogsl2.asl

** cat comp.add >>ogsl2.asl (temporarily add these as @sign to
   ogsl.asl and do a build as an easy way of getting them OIDs)

** script the addition of aka.tab to ogsl2.asl

** insert @name tags for select items that cause the @aka diagnostic
   but which it is undesirable or perhaps premature to change (ASAL₂,
   ITI, EŠ)

** manually fix the 60 or so "duplicate value", "same base", and
   repeated @uname/@ucode errors in ogsl.asl

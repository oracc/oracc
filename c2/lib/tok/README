TOKEN LISTS

C2 indexing is built around token lists--a token list is a table of WID\tOID\tADD (.woa)

WID is WORD-ID -- from the XTF file

OID is Oracc ID -- from oid.tab

ADD is ADDitional data, e.g., the full signature of a word instance

PRIMARY INDEXING

Primary indexing is done on everything with an OID:

	words senses signs values

(values do not yet have OIDs but they will)

The new ax will generate token lists natively; with ox(x) we will use
some built-in support and some expat-based programs to create
WID\tDOM\tKEY\t lists (.wdk). The OID resolver will turn .dko into
.woa.

To manage PCSL vs OGSL we could define pc as an alias for sl in the
DOM field, understanding that for sl we load ogsl and for pc we load
pcsl; these are not yet split in the OID tab but they should be one
day.

= Pure Ruby Interface of Hyper Estraier

Hyper Estraier is a full-text search system for communities.

== Introduction

This is a package implementing the node API of {Hyper Estraier}[http://fallabs.com/hyperestraier/].  This is a pure ruby package.  So, it works on Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, and so on.  It does not depend on the core library of Hyper Estraier.  Applications are implemented as clients of node servers running on local or remote machines.  This package requires Ruby 1.8.4 or later versions.

Though Hyper Estraier itself is released under the terms of the GNU LGPL, this package is released under the terms of a BSD-style license.

== Setting

Get the package of the latest version of Hyper Estraier.

Extract the package and enter the sub directory `rubypure' and perform installation.

 cd rubypure
 ./configure
 make
 su
 make install

The package `estraierpure' should be required in each source file of application programs and include the module `EstraierPure' at pleasure.

== Example of Gatherer

The following is the simplest implementation of a gatherer.

 require "estraierpure"
 include EstraierPure

 # create and configure the node connecton object
 node = Node::new
 node.set_url("http://localhost:1978/node/test1")
 node.set_auth("admin", "admin")

 # create a document object
 doc = Document::new

 # add attributes to the document object
 doc.add_attr("@uri", "http://estraier.gov/example.txt")
 doc.add_attr("@title", "Over the Rainbow")

 # add the body text to the document object
 doc.add_text("Somewhere over the rainbow.  Way up high.")
 doc.add_text("There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby.")

 # register the document object to the node
 unless node.put_doc(doc)
   STDERR.printf("error: %d\n", node.status)
 end

==Example of Searcher

The following is the simplest implementation of a searcher.

 require "estraierpure"
 include EstraierPure
 
 # create and configure the node connecton object
 node = Node::new
 node.set_url("http://localhost:1978/node/test1")

 # create a search condition object
 cond = Condition::new

 # set the search phrase to the search condition object
 cond.set_phrase("rainbow AND lullaby")

 # get the result of search
 nres = node.search(cond, 0);
 if nres
   # for each document in the result
   for i in 0...nres.doc_num
     # get a result document object
     rdoc = nres.get_doc(i)
     # display attributes
     value = rdoc.attr("@uri")
     printf("URI: %s\n", value) if value
     value = rdoc.attr("@title")
     printf("Title: %s\n", value) if value
     # display the snippet text */
     printf("%s", rdoc.snippet)
   end
 else
   STDERR.printf("error: %d\n", node.status)
 end

======

This directory contains a rewrite of core Oracc programs which are
intended to be easier to understand and maintain than the previous
implementation. As part of the rewrite, dependency on Perl for core
functions will be eliminated.

The following conversion programs are planned:

    ax	ATF (replaces 'ox')
    cx	CDF (replaces 'ox')	
    gx	Glossary (replaces ORACC::CBD::*)
    mx  Metadata (replaces xmdmanager.plx)
    ox  OIDs (replaces oid.plx and friends; main executable is oid not ox)
    sx	Signlist (replaces sl-xml.plx)
    tx	Test harnesses (e.g., gdlx)
    xx  Utility programs

In addition, the following functionality will be revised/rewrittten:

    ws	Web server (replaces oracc-server)
    p3	Web pager (replaces p3.plx)
    sc	Search/Context (replaces se/ce chain)
    ix  Indexer for ax/gx/mx/sx output

This will be done over a span of several years.

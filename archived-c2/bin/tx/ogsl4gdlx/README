OGSL GDL TEST SUITE

Invoke ./o4g.sh in this directory to extract the current signs, forms,
and values in OGSL and reduce them to the smallest test suite that
exercises every combination of GDL features that occurs in OGSL.

o4g.sh also runs ../gdlx -i -f ogsl-test.txt with output to stdout.
Any lines output indicate GDL parse failures or, less often, OGSL
encoding errors.

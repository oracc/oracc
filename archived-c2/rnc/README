Note that *.c and *.h are derived files which are require both java,
trang, and a perl script to create.  For this reason they are also
stored in the repo so that installations do not need to rebuild them.
The sources for the built files are the *.rnc files in this directory
and these rarely change.  At some point they will be formally fixed
and it will no longer be necessary to derive *.c and *.h.

For Sumerian, Emegir, Emesal, and Udgalnun langs can now be given at
glossary, entry, form, and base level.

An entry uses an RWS (Register/Writing System) code @EG, @ES, @UGN

A form uses %s, %e, %u -- the full forms %sux, %sux-x-emesal, and
%sux-x-udganu may be used, but the system automatically expands the
short forms

A base in @bases gives the lang before the base and after any stem,
with a space between the lang and the base: @bases *rr %s su-su

A base in an @form gives the lang after the / with : instead of space:
/%e:du₅-mu.  This is also the format in a signature.

LANG inherits as follows:

     * entry inherits from glossary lang, but @EG/ES/UGN overrides this
     * form inherits from entry lang, but <space>%lang<space> in form overrides this
     * base in bases inherits from entry lang, but %s/%e/%u overrides this
     * base in form inherits from the lang of its occurrence in @bases,
       but /%(s|e|u) overrides this
     * N.B.: base in form never inherits directly from the form's language

This means that you can have an EG word in an ES glossary and
differentiate EG/ES like this which has an ES form (based on
morphology) with EG entry and base:

 @entry e [speak] V/t
 @bases b·e₂
 @form de₃-em₃-ma-ab-be₂ %e /b·e₂ #da.Vmma.b:~

Some of these notations are unnecessary in source glossary files, but they are
implemented to support round-tripping from glossaries to .sig files and back to
glossaries.

If you need to include an EG form in an ES glossary, one which doesn't have an ES
base or any ES morphological markers, it is preferred practice to tag the form
with %s even though that is the default. This is taken by some validation processes
as a positive assertion that the presence of an EG form in an ES glossary is known
and acceptable. This is useful for PSUs where one component may have ES markers but
other components do not.

When .sig is output from .glo:

     * any RWS @EG/@ES/@UGN is output after the POS of the entry
     * if a form has a %lang it is used as the sig lang
     * if a base in the form has a lang, it is preserved
     * if a base in @bases has a lang that lang is inherited on the
       sig's base with the syntax /%s:dumu

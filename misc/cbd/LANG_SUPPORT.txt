For Sumerian, Emegir, Emesal, and Udgalnun langs can now be given at
glossary, entry, form, and base level.

An entry uses @EG, @ES, @UGN

A form uses %s, %e, %u -- the full forms %sux, %sux-x-emesal, and
%sux-x-udganu may be used, but the system automatically expands the
short forms

A base in @bases gives the lang before the base and after any stem,
with a space between the lang and the base: @bases *rr %s su-su

A base in an @form gives the lang after the / with : instead of space:
/%e:du₅-mu.  This is also the format in a signature.

LANG inherits such that forms and bases have the same lang as the
entry; the entry has the same lang as the glossary unless it uses
@EG/@ES/@UGN.

This means that you can have an EG word in an ES glossary and
differentiate EG/ES like this which has an ES form (based on
morphology) with EG entry and base:

 @entry e [speak] V/t
 @bases b·e₂
 @form de₃-em₃-ma-ab-be₂ %e /b·e₂ #da.Vmma.b:~

When .sig is output from .glo:

     * any @EG/@ES/@UGN is output after the POS of the entry
     * if a form has a %lang it is used as the sig lang
     * if a base in the form has a lang, it is preserved
     * if a base in @bases has a lang that lang is inherited on the
       sig's base with the syntax /%s:dumu

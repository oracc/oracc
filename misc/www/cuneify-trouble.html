    <h2>Trouble-shooting Cuneified Pages</h2>
    <p>We can confirm that FireFox, Safari, and Chrome are all capable of displaying Cuneified pages correctly, but sometimes different versions of the browsers on different operating systems do not work as expected. These issues are "client-side" issues--they must be fixed on the user's machine or the user's browser, as we are unable to fix them from the server-side.</p>
    
    <p>If you are not seeing the Cuneified pages in cuneiform--for SAAo, this is the Neo-Assyrian cuneiform--there are several things you might want to check and/or try:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Do you see the same results with different browsers? Are you able to try out the same page with more than one browser and compare the results?</li>
      <li>Do you have the NACuneifiedOutline.ttf font installed?
      <ul>
	<li>If not, please install it:
	  <ul>
	  <li>Download the current version of the font from <a href="http://oracc.org/downloads/CuneiformNA.zip">the Oracc website</a></li>
	  <li>Install the font to your system and restart as necessary (see <a href="http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/doc/help/visitingoracc/fonts/index.html">the Oracc Fonts page</a> for further help on this).</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>If so, it might be out of date--please uninstall it from your system and reinstall it as just described above.</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>Another possibility is that the stylesheet information is an old, cached, version, so you might try this:
      <ul>
	<li>Clear the history in your browser</li>
	<li>Close the browser</li>
	<li>Reopen the browser and try the Cuneified link again</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Some browsers have a setting to prefer user fonts over fonts requested by the page, or to disallow pages from using their own fonts.  It may help to investigate the display or font preferences of your browser.</li>
    </ul>
